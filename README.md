# Technical Test
Repository intended to develop a technical test for a company. (Only for demo porpuses)

## Short description
The test's goal is to build a CLI script to parse seatmaps information from XML files and create a JSON format file.

 
## Running The App

- You can get some help by running: ```python3 seatmap_parser.py -h ```

To run the application, you should run the command below, with only 1 flag (it's described on the --help section too):

- ```python3 seatmap_parser.py --filename seatmap1.xml```

- --file: it's the xml file name. It must be inside the ***data*** folder.

- The output you are going to obtain will be placed in ***/data/output*** folder with the same name of your file but in JSON format.
